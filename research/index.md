#### Statistics
* Bayesian nonparametrics
* sequential monte carlo (particle filters)
* expectation propagation and variational inference
* spatial data
* time series data
* causal inference
* MCMC with massive data (e.g. [Firefly](https://github.com/HIPS/firefly-monte-carlo))

#### Biology
* infectious disease
* metagenomics
* evolutionary dynamics
