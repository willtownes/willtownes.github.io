### Class Projects and Other Unpublished Work

#### Bayesian Nonparametric Time Series Modeling
with [Jeremiah Zhe Liu](http://jereliu.github.io/)- class project for [MIT 6.882](http://www.tamarabroderick.com/course_6_882.html).

#### Family Based Association Tests for Rare Variants
with [Christoph Lange](http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/christoph-lange/)- first year Ph.D. summer project.
