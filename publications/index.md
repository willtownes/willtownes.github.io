### Class Projects and Other Unpublished Work

#### Variational Inference for Mixtures of Dirichlet Network Distributions
Class project for Harvard Computer Science 282R- Bayesian Nonparametrics.

#### Bayesian Nonparametric Time Series Modeling
with [Jeremiah Zhe Liu](http://jereliu.github.io/)- class project for [MIT 6.882](http://www.tamarabroderick.com/course_6_882.html). We implemented a hierarchical dirichlet process/ hidden markov model switching linear dynamical system in R in a replication of portions of [Emily Fox](http://www.stat.washington.edu/~ebfox/index.html)'s dissertation.

#### Family Based Association Tests for Rare Variants
with [Christoph Lange](http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/christoph-lange/)- first year Ph.D. summer project.

#### Network Connectivity and Infectious Disease Modeling
with [JP Onnela](http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/onnela-lab/) and Carla Marquez-Luna
