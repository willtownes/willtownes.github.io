\section{Summary}
I am a postdoctoral researcher focused on biomedical data science. I work with Barbara Engelhardt in the Princeton Computer Science Department. My interests include unsupervised machine learning, genomics, and infectious disease. My goal is to produce statistical methods and open source software implementations to help scientists achieve their research goals more effectively.
