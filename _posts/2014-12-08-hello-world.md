Welcome to my new technical blog. I have been posting on [wordpress](http://willtownes.wordpress.com) for a while, but wanted to try out the new Jekyll system which is supposed to be better for posting snippets of computer code, $ \LaTeX $, markdown, and other interesting things. Also, I like that it is attached to github which facilitates version control. In creating this site, I relied heavily on advice found in [this tutorial](https://www.andrewmunsell.com/tutorials/jekyll-by-example). The main commands to remember are:

    jekyll build
    jekyll serve
    jekyll serve --watch
